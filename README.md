# Programming Excercises

There are a lot of sites out there that target the mind of programmers
and they are very helpful when it comes to practice programming tricks
and concepts.

## There is a tools folder containing C++ classes for:

* Computing Primes
* Computing Collatz numbers
* More in the future

## There is a `misc` folder containing:

* Failed atempts at solving some problems
* Useful faliures ... :)
* Some other junk
